# Spotify Puller

Hey! Thanks for looking at my program.

I have quite a few plans for this one.

Firstly, the current features:
This program allows a user to view the amount of monthly listeners an artist has, as well as the genres in which an artist is apart of.
This program also allows a user to view the public playlists of a Spotify profile given their User ID, and to export those playlists into a text file.

In the future, I want to go into each playlist, view the tracks, and view details of the tracks. Also, I would like to be able to view private playlists (with user login). Eventually I want to have a website with nuanced details about artists, with graphs and the whole shebang. Then, with the exported playlists/tracks, I will be able to migrate Spotify libraries to Apple Music, Pandora, Tidal, etc. with user's logins (on their respective playforms).
